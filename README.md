# Unhinged

A CLI-based dating app software built in C++.

The NachenSmall Software Corporation has traditionally only built software for running senior-citizen bingo games and has decided to pivot into a new area. Theyâ€™ve decided to disrupt the online matchmaking market and build a new dating app, Unhinged.

Using a text file (members.txt), Unhinged outputs the most suitable partners based on a specific numeric threshold. Compatibility is gauged by the similarity in profile attributes, defined in translators.txt. To suggest potential matches, the program utilizes a space-efficient RadixTree data structure. This command-line tool can handle up to 100,000 member profiles.

## How to build

- `git clone https://github.com/ArshMalik02/Unhinged`
- `cd Unhinged` and run the main program.
- Follow the terminal prompts.
